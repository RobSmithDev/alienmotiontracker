# Alien Style Motion Tracker

I decided it was time to build a fully working M314 Motion Tracker. I've always loved the Aliens films and franchise, and this has been something I've wanted to build for over 10 years.
Unlike other replicas, this one not only makes the sounds and has a display, but it *actually tracks motion* up to about 11ish meters.
This project uses the DreamRF+Radar Hat for the Raspberry Pi, powered by the BGT60TR13C from Infineon.

My hope is that the community effort will improve this project even further, and I'm excited to see where this goes.
